Exactly one year ago I was landing in [Quito](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/05/29/digital-nomad-quito-wifitribe/). My one-way ticket in one hand and my suitcase in the other. A suitcase full of dreams and hopes, but mainly full of clothes suitable for any season and kind of adventure!

In the last 365 days I lived and [worked remotely](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/03/24/adventure-digital-nomad-latin-america-wifitribe/) from **10 countries**: [Ecuador](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/05/29/digital-nomad-quito-wifitribe/), [Peru](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/06/26/digital-nomad-lima-wifitribe/), Bolivia, [Chile](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/09/03/road-trip-campervan-atacama-desert/), [Brazil](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/09/11/living-like-local-rio-de-janeiro/), [Argentina](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/11/08/patagonia-journey-penguins-glaciers-blue-lakes/), Mexico, [Cuba](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2019/01/10/living-like-local-havana/), Costa Rica and Colombia.

I took **43 flights**.

I visited **3 New Wonders of the World**.

I met so many people from all over the world.

And I learned how to travel. This was my **first time outside Europe**, my first travel on my own, and I was a bit scared. I started the easy way, joining the best nomad community in the world: [WiFi Tribe](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/tag/wifitribe/). Accommodation and wifi were already arranged, I was provided with new amazing friends and a safe environment.

Easy, right? I traveled with them for **10 months** and we lived incredible experiences and adventures together, but, when I started to spend more time with locals than with the community, I understood I had to change something. Speaking Spanish gave me an advantage for meeting locals easily, diving into their culture and living real local experiences. So I realized I was ready.

And there was when my new solo adventure started. I decided to stop traveling with the Tribe and go back to the countries I loved more, starting from my favorite: Brazil.

I have been living in [Rio de Janeiro](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/09/11/living-like-local-rio-de-janeiro/) for 2 months now and I love it. I learned **Portuguese**, I met again friends from the first time I went here, and I'm constantly meeting new people thanks to [Couchsurfing](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/09/18/cordoba-digital-nomad-solo-traveler/). Traveling solo doesn't mean you are alone!

Sadly, I will leave Rio in a week and I will go back to Italy for a month. You know, after one year it's good to go back to parents and friends, right? But I will not stop! I already booked flights to Iceland, New York and Mexico! And from there I will keep going: probably Guatemala, Belize and back to Colombia and Brazil again. New adventures are waiting for me!

I started to travel with one main goal: escaping from my comfort zone. I decided I wanted to be a ["Yes Man"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/) and I said yes to everything.

Eating ants in the jungle? Yes. Swimming in a river with pirañas? Yes. Bathing in a 10° lagoon? Yes. Jumping from a waterfall? Yes.

I did things I never thought I could do! I went beyond my limits and I understood that everything is possible. It's just a mindset. If you stop thinking you can't do it, you will do it! And it applies to everything.

Something I love about traveling is also learning new skills: I improved in **surfing**, I got the PADI certificate in **Scuba Diving**, I learned to dance **salsa** and **tango** and I'm attending a **rock climbing** course here in Rio.

Here are some highlights from the past year in Latin America.

A pretty intense year, isn't it?

Those experiences were amazing, but what really matters more are the people I met along the way, their cultures, their stories, their teachings. Doing and seeing wonderful things is cool, but they are just a list in a post if you don't experience places deeply, instead of being just a tourist.

I prefer just to settle down in a city for one or two of months, meeting locals and understand how life is there, rather than moving every week, looking for the next big thing. **Slow traveling** is the best way for me.
