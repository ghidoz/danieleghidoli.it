One of my 2018's resolution was **opening a travel blog**. Another oneÂ was to start a long travel through South America.

Well, for the first one, here we are! This is my new travel blog, where I will start sharing tips and experiences from my **travels in Spain**.

The truth is that I haven't traveled a lot yet: I have been many times to **Canary Islands** (Lanzarote, Tenerife and Gran Canaria) and I lived for 4 months in **Fuerteventura**. I love that islands for the surf, the weather and the awesome landscapes. I will tell you more soon.

I have lived for 2 years in **Barcelona** and I know it very well: I can recommend the best places to visit in the city and in Catalunya and where to eat.

I did also some trips in Spain: from the **Basque Country** (Bilbao, San Sebastian) to **Galicia**. And also in the south (**Granada**).

There are many places I can write about, but I'm also planning a long travel in **South America as a Digital Nomad**, so I hope to have many more adventures to tell you soon!

Stay tuned!
