When the **pandemic** broke out in 2020, I was in **Siem Reap, Cambodia**. The world started to collapse on its own, borders shut down, countries locked down... and I found myself **stranded in Cambodia for five long months**.

Was it hard? Was it scary? Being in an undeveloped foreign country while a pandemic is raging worldwide. What if I get sick too? Would they have the infrastructure to handle it? Should I try to go back home?

The truth is: it was **amazing**! The best place where to be stuck in the world at that moment in history. It felt like living on a **different planet**. While Italy had been in quarantine for two months, in Cambodia it was as if the virus had completely died out. I had the opportunity of experiencing Cambodia like no one before.

The famous thousand-year-old temples of **Angkor**, which attract millions of tourists from all over the world every year, were **almost empty.** I was able to visit them with absolutely no crowds of tourists around. I had them all to myself.

And then I met **Sina**. A brave Cambodian woman with an enormous heart, but a dark and **rebellious side**. She became my symbolic **local guide** on my journey to discover a mysterious, rural, controversial, and magical culture.

I wrote everything about my Cambodian adventure in a **book** I just published: [My Cambodia](https://amzn.to/3v5Qosl).

It's not a travel guide. It's more like a **novel**, a story. The story of Sina, her scars, her visions, and her struggles in a culture that doesn't accept her and that she rejects too. But the meeting between Sina and me would change things.
