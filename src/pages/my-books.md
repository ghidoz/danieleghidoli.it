One of my favorite things about traveling is meeting local people and listening to their stories. Stories that are always unique and worth being told. And sometimes, stories that are worth becoming a book.

Here you find my books!

## My Cambodia

[![](~/assets/images/my-cambodia-download.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3v5Qosl)

My most recent book is a **travel memoir** of my five months **stuck in Cambodia** in early 2020 when the Covid **pandemic** broke out. There I met Sina, a brave Cambodian woman with an enormous heart, but a dark and rebellious side. She became my symbolic local guide on my journey to discover a mysterious, rural, controversial, and magical culture.

You can download the [English version](https://amzn.to/3v5Qosl) or the [Italian version](https://amzn.to/3Fxi5Rb) on Amazon.

## In the Land of Salsa: Living Like a Local in Havana

This is my first book, a short **travel memoir** I wrote after spending a week in **Cuba**, where I hung out with locals, heard their stories, and experienced true local life. I decided to collect everything in a small book so that you can make the same trip and discover Havana with me.

You can download the [ebook version](https://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/cuba-book) from Amazon or buy the paperback if you prefer.

I hope you will enjoy reading about my adventures as much as I enjoyed experiencing and writing them. If you like them, please consider leaving a **positive review** on Amazon, after you've read them!
