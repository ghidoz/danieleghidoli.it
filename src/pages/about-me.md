Hi there! I'm an Italian Web Developer, traveling the World as a **digital nomad**.

In 2009 I founded [BigThink](http://www.bigthink.it), my **Digital Agency** focused on developing Facebook Apps and contest. After six years in an office in the grey Milan, I founded [Musikee](https://musikee.com), my own **music startup** and I moved for 4 months in **Fuerteventura**, embracing the Digital Nomad philosophy.

Then I settled down in **Barcelona** for almost 2 years, where I worked as an **Angular Developer** for [Wallapop](http://wallapop.com/), the coolest Startup in Spain!

On April 2018, I started my adventure in **Latin America**, working remotely as a freelance developer and traveling for 10 months with the [WiFi Tribe community](http://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/03/24/adventure-digital-nomad-latin-america-wifitribe/) of digital nomads.

From February 2019, I kept traveling **on my own**.

Things I love: the web, traveling, surf, parkour, capoeira, acrobatics.

If you would like to know more about me, you can read my [technical blog about Angular](https://blog.danieleghidoli.it/), my personal blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ghido) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ghido) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/ghidoz/).
