Hi there! I'm an Italian Frontend Engineer, traveling through South America as a [**Digital Nomad**](http://nomad.danieleghidoli.it).

In 2009 I founded [BigThink](http://www.bigthink.it), my **Digital Agency** focused on developing Facebook Apps and contest. After six years in an office in the grey Milan, I founded [Musikee](https://musikee.com), my own **music startup** and I moved for 4 months in **Fuerteventura**, embracing the Digital Nomad philosophy.

Then I settled down in **Barcelona** for almost 2 years, where I worked as **Angular Developer** for [Wallapop](http://wallapop.com/), the coolest Startup in Spain!

Now I'm still working for them as a freelance, while I travel the World with [WifiTribe](http://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/2018/03/24/adventure-digital-nomad-latin-america-wifitribe/). You can check [where I am](http://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/where-i-am/) at the moment!

I also do Angular one to one **mentoring sessions** on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/ghido). Don't hesitate to [book a session](https://www.codementor.io/ghido) if you need help!

All the photos in the articles of this blog are made by me or my friends (Walter Crispino and Chiara Crispino) during our travels and adventures.

If you would like to know more about me, you can read my [travel blog](http://nomad.danieleghidoli.it/) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ghido) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/ghidoz/).
